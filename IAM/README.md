ðŸ”¹ What is IAM?

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.
It allows you to manage who (identity) can access what (resources) under which conditions (policies).


ðŸ”¹ Key Features of IAM:

  âœ… Users

Represents individual people or applications.

Each user has credentials (username/password, access keys).

âœ… Groups

A collection of users.

Permissions assigned to a group are automatically applied to all members.

âœ… Roles

Used to grant temporary access to AWS resources.

Commonly used by services (EC2, Lambda, etc.) or cross-account access.

âœ… Policies

JSON documents that define permissions.

Example: Allow an EC2 instance to read from an S3 bucket.
