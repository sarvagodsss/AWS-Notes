ðŸ”¹ What is IAM?

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.
It allows you to manage who (identity) can access what (resources) under which conditions (policies).


ðŸ”¹ Key Features of IAM:

  âœ… Users

Represents individual people or applications.

Each user has credentials (username/password, access keys).

âœ… Groups

A collection of users.

Permissions assigned to a group are automatically applied to all members.

âœ… Roles

Used to grant temporary access to AWS resources.

Commonly used by services (EC2, Lambda, etc.) or cross-account access.

âœ… Policies

JSON documents that define permissions.

Example: Allow an EC2 instance to read from an S3 bucket.

ðŸ›  Steps in AWS IAM

Groups are used to assign common permissions to multiple users.

Sign in to the AWS Management Console â†’ open IAM service.

In the left panel â†’ Click User groups â†’ Create group.

Enter Group name (e.g., Developers).

(Optional) Attach a Policy (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Click Create group.

âœ… Group created.

2. Create a User

Users represent individuals or applications.

In IAM â†’ Click Users â†’ Add users.

Enter User name (e.g., santosh).

Choose Access type:

Password (for Console access).

Access key (for CLI/SDK/API access).

Click Next.

Add user to an existing group (e.g., Developers).

Review and click Create user.

3. Assign Permissions

There are 3 ways to give permissions:

a) Attach Policy to a Group (Recommended âœ…)

Attach a policy (like AmazonEC2FullAccess) to the Group.

All users in that group will get the same permissions.

b) Attach Policy to a User

Go to User â†’ Permissions â†’ Add permissions â†’ Attach policies directly.

Example: Attach AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.

c) Attach Inline Policy (Custom JSON)

Go to User or Group â†’ Permissions â†’ Add inline policy.

Example policy to allow S3 bucket read-only access:
